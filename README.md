## Chat!

Start up the server and have a friend connect with their client and start chatting.

Play a Wordle clone (6 letters and 6 guesses) with the server if you're not feeling especially chatty. Start the game by sending '/game' to the server from the client at any time. Just type '/end' to stop playing whenever you feel like it.
